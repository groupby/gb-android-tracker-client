# GroupBy Tracker Client for Android

This is the Android SDK used to send beacons to GroupBy.

Like other GroupBy beacon SDKs, it allows you to send a beacon representing a shopping event to GroupBy whenever that event occurs. This causes anonymous information about the shopper and the search results and products they interact with to be saved in GroupBy's systems to power GroupBy's platform.

Examples of platform components enhanced by beacons:

* Search results are more personalized
* Recommendations are better
* Insights are available in analytics dashboards

See [docs](docs/docs.md) for documentation.
