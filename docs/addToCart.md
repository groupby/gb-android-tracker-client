# addToCart

For sending details of which products (or SKUs within products) the shopper is adding to their cart.

You must only include the products or SKUs that the shopper is adding to their cart during this event, not the products or SKUs the cart has after this event occurs.

## Example

```java
// Create instance of tracker
String customerId = "<your-customer-id>";
String area = "<your-area>";
// Represents a shopper who is not logged in
Login login = new Login();
login.setLoggedIn(false);
login.setUsername(null);
GbTracker tracker = GbTracker.getInstance(customerId, area, login);

// Code below assumes a tracker has been created called "tracker"

// Prepare price for product
Price price = new Price();
price.setActual("12.34");
price.setCurrency("usd");
price.setOnSale(true);
price.setRegular("23.45");

// Prepare product for cart item
Product product = new Product();
product.setCategory("abc123");
product.setCollection("abc123");
product.setId("abc123");
product.setPrice(price);
product.setSku("abc123");
product.setTitle("abc123");

// Prepare cart item for list of cart items
CartItem item = new CartItem();
item.setProduct(product);
item.setQuantity(1);

// Prepare list of cart items for cart
List<CartItem> items = new ArrayList<>();
items.add(item);

// Prepare cart for event
Cart cart = new Cart();
cart.setItems(items);
cart.setType("abc123");

// Prepare event for beacon
AddToCartEvent event = new AddToCartEvent();
event.setGoogleAttributionToken("abc123");
event.setCart(cart);

// Prepare beacon for request
AddToCartBeacon beacon = new AddToCartBeacon();
beacon.setEvent(event);
beacon.setMetadata(null);
beacon.setExperiments(null);

// Use tracker instance to send beacon
tracker.sendAddToCartEvent(beacon, new GbCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(GbException e, int statusCode) {
        String msg = "Failed to send beacon: " + e.getMessage();
        if (statusCode == 400  && e.getError() != null) {
            List<String> validationErrors = e.getError().getJsonSchemaValidationErrors();
            msg = msg + "; validation errors: " + validationErrors;
        }
        Log.e("TEST", msg, e);
    }
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        String msg = "Sent beacon successfully.";
        Log.i("TEST", msg);
    }
});
```

In the real world, you should re-use your tracker instance across the lifetime of your app, not create a new instance each time you want to send a beacon. These code examples create new tracker instances each time for demonstration purposes.
